###routing
extjs:generate-admin generator.yml route prefix is not set correctly to the modulename
does with_propel_route in the generator.yml do anything?
possible to work without route_prefix and no propel route?
look at _assets.js index.js and fix to properly use route_prefix instead of moduleName()
getXtype module should support routing and be called with the route instead of the moduleName()

### forms
show combobox for related fields (field is not always added)
- this is a problem with the standard generator too

formpanel updatebuttonvisibility needs to be looked at
- don't show delete buttons when object is not created yet in edit-form
- save as new does not work

look at how to handle a form with another form embedded in it, document if not possible

need to create a newformpanel and an editformpanel so different forms can displayed in each

### grid
foreign columns should show __toString() output in list
foreign columns should be clickable to open an adminstration for that foreign table if one exists

### generic
add time display for datetime fields to list, filter, and edit
add support for objects with multiple fields as primary key

error handling
- need to catch errors when index.js doesn't load because of a problem with the javascript
- need to show errors on ajax requests and show them in a window

###remote combos (WIP set attributes.mode.remote to test )
filterpanel support
displays the value instead of display field when no combo store is loaded
type ahead filtering not implemented
no return limit or paging
support for query_method options not implemented

### defered
add ext components not lazy loaded list to app.yml
add a way to disable bottombar
grid editing
grid row expander
grid grouping

use sfGrid (once it is ready)
