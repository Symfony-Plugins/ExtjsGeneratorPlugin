### forms
add a hiddenfield widget

show combobox for related fields (field is not always added)
- this is a problem with the standard generator too

formpanel updatebuttonvisibility needs to be looked at
- don't show delete buttons when object is not created yet in edit-form
- save and new does not work

label doesn't apply to many to many fields

### grid
foreign columns should show __toString() output in list
foreign columns should be clickable to open an adminstration for that foreign table if one exists
auto add ^object_actions as last column if object_actions are enabled

### filter
move is_empty checkbox for filter to an Ext.ux extension
is_empty doesn't reset when value is set from the session
is_empty should clear associated fields when set
is_empty oncheck listener to submit the filter

### generic
add time display for datetime fields to list, filter, and edit
refactor evals in generator partials
add default fieldset styles
fix widgetOptions for the itemselector for many to many in formpanels
use heredoc in ExtjsGenerator for getStandardPartials, createStandardConstructorPartial, createStandardInitComponentPartial, createStandardInitEventsPartial methods

add support for objects with multiple fields as primary key

error handling

backport changes in sfPropel15Plugin admin15 to forms, filters, widgets, and routing

### defered
add ext components not lazy loaded list to app.yml
add a way to disable bottombar
