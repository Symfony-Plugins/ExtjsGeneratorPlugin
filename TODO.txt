###routing
extjs:generate-admin generator.yml route prefix is not set correctly to the modulename
does with_propel_route in the generator.yml do anything?
possible to work without route_prefix and no propel route?
look at _assets.js index.js and fix to properly use route_prefix instead of moduleName()

### forms
show combobox for related fields (field is not always added)
- this is a problem with the standard generator too

formpanel updatebuttonvisibility needs to be looked at
- don't show delete buttons when object is not created yet in edit-form
- save and new does not work

label doesn't apply to many to many fields
look at how to handle a form with another form embedded in it, document if not possible

### grid
foreign columns should show __toString() output in list
foreign columns should be clickable to open an adminstration for that foreign table if one exists
need to escape single quotes in labels for columnmodel
sort on foreign columns with many to one administrations

### filter
move is_empty checkbox for filter to an Ext.ux extension
is_empty doesn't reset when value is set from the session
is_empty should clear associated fields when set
is_empty oncheck listener to submit the filter
filter on foreign columns with many to one administrations

### generic
add time display for datetime fields to list, filter, and edit
use heredoc in ExtjsGenerator for getStandardPartials, createStandardConstructorPartial, createStandardInitComponentPartial, createStandardInitEventsPartial methods
expand generated partials with examples
add support for objects with multiple fields as primary key

error handling

backport changes in sfPropel15Plugin admin15 to forms, filters, widgets, and routing

filterpanel support
displays the value instead of display field when no combo store is loaded
type ahead filtering not implemented

support for query_method options not implemented
non-foreign fields distint or grouping not implemented

### defered
add ext components not lazy loaded list to app.yml
add a way to disable bottombar
grid editing
grid row expander
grid grouping

use sfGrid (once it is ready)
